# _2XKO_ - Data Dragon

Do you want to use DDragon for an another game from _Riot Games_? Check the _Data Dragon_ repository for [_League of Legends_](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoL_DDragon), [_Legends of Runeterra_](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoR_DDragon), or [_Valorant_](https://github.com/InFinity54/Valorant_DDragon). _Teamfight Tactics_ data is now included in LoL's _Data Dragon_ repository.

## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_2XKO_](https://2xko.riotgames.com), distributed by Riot Games. The game isn't available yet, so _Data Dragon_ content isn't available too. However, some additional content has already been added. This repository will be updated as soon as _Data Dragon_ will be available for it (if it happens one day).
